# Evaluating Metrics

- Volume-based metric
    
    - Dice metric
        
        measures the ratio of overlap between two results (e.g., automatic segmentation vs. manual segmentation), ranging from 0 (mismatch) to 1 (perfect match)
        
    - Jaccard similarity index
        
- Surface distance-based metric
    
    - mean contour distance
        
    - Hausdorff distance
        
- Clinical performance metrics
    
    - ventricular volume and mass
        

# Clinical Significance

- Segmentation maps are important for deriving clinical indices, such as left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), right ventricular enddiastolic volume (RVEDV), right ventricular end-systolic volume (RVESV), and EF.
    
- Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac electrical disorders, affecting around 1 million people in the UK5. Accordingly, atrial segmentation is of prime importance in the clinic, improving the assessment of the atrial anatomy in both pre-operative AF ablation planning and post-operative follow-up evaluations
